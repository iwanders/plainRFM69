/*
    The plainRFM69 object only provides the essential functions to receive and
    sent packets using the RFM69 radio module. It builds on top of bareRFM69
    to address the hardware.

    The normal state of the radio is to listen to packets, the poll() method
    should be called to obtain the packet from the radio hardare and place it
    into the plainRFM69's buffer. From this buffer it can then be read.

    The AutoModes of the radio module are used. This allows the most efficient
    transmissions of data, only enabling the transmitter when the data is ready
    to be sent. The AutoMode is also used for the receiving state, once a packet
    is received the radio is put in standby mode until the packet is retreived
    by the poll() method.

    The poll() method can also be attached to an interrupt, allowing efficient
    retrieval of packets from the FIFO and placing them in the buffer such that
    they are available outside of the interrupt.
